    <h2 class="hidden"> What is the Length of the Legislature? </h2>
    <p class="text_column"> There is no consistency in how long a legislative session is scheduled. The length of a session may be set by a state's constitution, a statute, or by the legislature and varies among the states. </p>
	<p class="text_column_two"> *Four States meet only once every two years, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, and Texas. Meaning that you have limited days and even less opportunity to rectify laws. </p>

	<h2 class="hidden"> What are Bill Introduction Limits? </h2>
    <p class="text_column"> Many states limit the amount of bills that can be introduced in a session. This is more often than not a law but a rule set by the rules committee. This was done as a way to prevent filing legislation for the sake of running out an already limited clock on passing legislation. This has become an ongoing problem in trying to get legislation sponsored, legislators will say that even though they support the legislation and will sign on as a co-sponsor, they have already committed on what laws they will propose. Add to that the challenge of having your legislation sponsored by someone is in the majority party, especially during these hyper partisan times. </p>

	<h2 class="head"> False Critical Information: </h2> 
    <p class="text_column"> In several states, including over the course of the 2019 legislative session, public information available online regarding deadlines and dates did not match the practice of the legislature. While states often list filing deadlines, they neglect to inform the public about intent-to-file deadlines. Members must declare their intent to file an upcoming bill before it can be filed.  Once missed, these earlier intent-to-file deadlines make it impossible for legislation to be brought forward.</p>

	<h2 class="hidden"> What is the purpose of a Legislative Calendar? </h2>
    <p class="text_column"> In every state the legislative calendar, or agenda, determine both which bills will be heard during a given day and the order they will be heard in. Each state has a different method of determining the calendar and in some states a committee or individual holds lots of power over the calendar. </p>
